something brief about myself

Hi,
I am Sanjid, a former civil engineer who found his zing in data analysis and coding. I slowly started this 'HELLO WORLD!!' journey on the later half of 2022 and surely I got myself into endless learning process. What keeps me going is how interesting it is to code and at the same time, how frustrating it can get when it does not work. But there is just so much data in everything, I mean the endless possiblities!!

I like to be very transparent and straight forward. I beleive it is not silly not to know something very basic or simple, but it is silly not to learn that. Most of the descriptions will have my failures aswell as my coding journey continues. Coding is not all sun shine and rainbows afterall. And I firmly belive that adding humour and actual reality to professional field would not harm anyone.


Happy conding!!
